          <h2>Meet Coach Sayf</h2>
          <p>
            Coach Sayf is a lifelong student of the sport, a committed mentor,
            and a proud member of the community. With over a decade of wrestling
            experience — both as an athlete and a coach — he brings intensity,
            discipline, and purpose to every session. His coaching philosophy is
            rooted in growth: mentally, physically, and spiritually.
          </p>
          <p>
            As someone who’s benefited deeply from the structure and values
            wrestling brings, Coach Sayf founded Ummah United to create a space
            where young men and women can grow into strong, focused, and
            grounded individuals. His approach is both competitive and
            compassionate — pushing athletes to strive for their best while
            respecting each individual’s journey.

          <h2>Why We Exist</h2>
          <p>
            Ummah United Wrestling Club was founded to serve a higher purpose —
            to develop strong individuals who embody the values of
            accountability, respect, effort, and discipline both on and off the
            mat. This isn’t just about takedowns and drills. It’s about building
            character through struggle, perseverance, and responsibility.
          </p>
          <p>
            Wrestling has long been a Sunnah of the Prophet ﷺ and serves as a
            practical outlet for youth development, leadership, and spiritual
            growth. Our doors are open to all, regardless of background — we are
            united by purpose.

          <p>
            “Ummah” refers to the unified community — and that’s what we’re
            building through wrestling: brotherhood, mentorship, and collective
            growth. This club is more than a program. It’s a mission.
